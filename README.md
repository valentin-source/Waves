# Waves
Simple 2D Flight Game (in pre-alpha) with funny physics simulation

## Goal
There currently isnt a real Goal in the game yet, but i've added a score to see how many seconds you stayed alive🤷‍♂️

## how to play
You can use w,a,s,d to move around. There are forces acting on you such as gravity, wind.
If you get hit by one of the other Spheres, the game stops. The game can be restarted by pressing "r".
Red Spheres have constant acceleration -> Need to accelerate/ decelerate but have high maximum speeds.
Yellow Spheres have a constant speed but relatively low maximum speed.

## how to run
See  [Documentation.md](Documentation.md)
