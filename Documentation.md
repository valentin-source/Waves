### Code can be compiled and run using the Processing IDE ( https://www.processing.org )
Processing 4.0b2 was used to create the game, will probably work on all Processing 3 Versions as well.


The .exe File can also be used to test/ play the game, but you'll need the JDK 11 installed in order to run it.
The .exe might also not always be up to date
